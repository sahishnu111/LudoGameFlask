## Ludo Game - Flask Backend

This project provides the backend for a Ludo game using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and a bit of JavaScript for the frontend.

### Features

* **Multiplayer:** Supports 2-4 players.
* **Game State Persistence:** Stores game progress in a SQLite database for resuming later.
* **Dice Rolls:**  Random dice generation for each turn.
* **Piece Movement:**  Logic for moving pieces based on dice rolls.
* **Attack/Capture:**  Basic capture mechanics when a player lands on another player's piece.
* **Safe Spots:**  Designated spots where pieces cannot be captured.
* **Winning Condition:**  Game ends when a player gets all four pieces home.


### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask Flask-CORS Flask-SQLAlchemy
   ```

3. **Create the Database:** The project will automatically create a SQLite database file (`ludo_game.db`) when you run it for the first time.

4. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Frontend

A basic HTML and JavaScript frontend is included in the `templates` folder. It's a starting point for building a more interactive UI.

### Code Structure

* **app.py:**  Contains the Flask application logic, routes, and game logic.
* **templates:**
    * **index.html:**  Starting page for the game.
    * **game.html:**  Main game board display.
* **static:** (For future use) Will hold static assets like CSS and JavaScript files.

### How to Play (Basic)

1. Visit `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser.
2. Choose the number of players.
3. The game board will appear.
4. Click "Roll Dice" to start.
5. Follow on-screen instructions or the console output for your turn.

### Code Refinements

* **Session Management:** Use `flask_session` for more secure session handling if needed.
* **Error Handling:**  More robust error handling to prevent crashes and provide helpful messages to the user.
* **Advanced Game Logic:** Implement additional rules like stacking pieces, bonus rolls, and more strategic movement decisions.
* **Frontend:** Create a more engaging frontend using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js).
* **Security:**  If you plan to make this a publicly accessible game, consider security measures like input validation and protection against vulnerabilities.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.



**Key Considerations**

* **Computer Players:** Your code includes functionality for computer players (`auto_choose_piece`), but it might need refinement to make their decisions more intelligent.
* **Game State Updates:** Ensure that the frontend is updated with the latest game state after each move. This might involve using techniques like AJAX or WebSockets.
* **Detailed Rules:** Include a more thorough explanation of the game rules (especially for complex scenarios) in the README or within the game itself.
